# DSA-Code-Motion-Visualizer
Developed an interactive visualization platform that animates step-by-step execution of DSA problems, helping users understand recursion, loops, and memory flow
 Implemented a custom execution engine in TypeScript to simulate call stacks, variable states, and memory references in
real time.
• Designed dynamic visualizations of recursion stacks, variables, and control flow using React components and Tailwind
CSS, enhancing user engagement and clarity.
• Built with a modern frontend stack (React + Vite + TypeScript) ensuring fast builds, modular design, and scalable
performance
